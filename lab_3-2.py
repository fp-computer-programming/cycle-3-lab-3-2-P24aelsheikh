Create a Python file named lab_3-2.py
Copy the following examples into a Python file one at a time. 
Think about what kind of error you think it will throw before running the code. 
When you have run one line, be sure to comment it before adding your next line.
After you have commented out a line, add a comment listing what error type occured.
	
 	int(a)
	int('a')
	'a' + 2
	import date
	print("I'm a happy camper!)

"""
int(a)
#name error
#define a
int('a')
#value error
#remove parentices so code isnt seen as a comment
'a' + 2
#type error
#has to be a string 
import date
#module not Found error
#create a module for date
print("I'm a happy camper!)
#syntax error 
#add quotation to close it off
